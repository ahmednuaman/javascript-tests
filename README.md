# JavaScript Tests [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ahmednuaman/javascript-tests.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ahmednuaman/javascript-tests)

A suite of JavaScript tests (hopefully) useful for interviews

## How to use

1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`/`npm watch`
3. Get the candidate to complete the tests and Karma should watch the files and run the tests on save.

#problem with Karma
For the reason of depricated methods and frameworks the test didn't work
I was going to change the test to jest, yet I went to test everything using the terminal with console.log()
