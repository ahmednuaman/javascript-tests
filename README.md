# JavaScript Tests [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eSynergySolutions/javascript-tests.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eSynergySolutions/javascript-tests)

A suite of JavaScript tests (hopefully) useful for interviews

## How to use
1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`/`npm watch`
3. Get the candidate to complete the tests and Karma should watch the files and run the tests on save.

## "But these tests are broke"
Yes, yes they are broke. I need you to fix them and make a PR :)
